## Centralized Error Handling ##

1. DRY principle (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself):
Avoid repeating try/catch logic in every database function.

2. Consistency:
You return the same type/format of error response across the app (e.g., for logging, or API error codes).

3. Improved Debugging:
You can log or reformat errors in one place before they bubble up.

4. Easier Maintenance:
Changes in error formatting or logging only happen in one location.

Examples:  function catchPrismaErrors(){}
